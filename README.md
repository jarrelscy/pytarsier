# pytarsier
Python implementation of VisTarsier (core features)
https://github.com/mh-cad/vistarsier

This includes a simplified python implementation of VisTarsier's primary functionality which can be run from within a Docker container.

## Caution
This is a work in progress and will currently produce results with a significantly high rate of false negatives than the original VT implementation.

## Docker build
